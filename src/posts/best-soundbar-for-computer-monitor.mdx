  - body: "It is the very first soundbar of Razer after its incredible product line
      of Keyboards. The soundbar's overall design is simple, yet black color in
      just 20-inches long soundbar gives a stunning glance. The soundbar's
      compact size makes it the best soundbar for a computer monitor because it
      won't consume much space and can fit with any screen size of the monitor.
      \r

      At the front, you get to see two tweeters and drivers at each side
      responsible for producing exceptional voice. I call it a gaming soundbar
      because the audio quality is impressive and clear that would fill up space
      and provide a breathtaking experience. However, you can choose the mode
      among movie, game, and music to produce the sound accordingly. \r

      The power button puts at the top, whereas the connectivity ports are
      at the back. It also includes a compact subwoofer, though it requires a
      wired connection. However, the soundbar contains NFC that instantly
      connects with Android devices, and BlueTooth will make the IOS devices
      connection easy. Besides, you can adjust the bass or treble level
      of  Leviathan manually by moving the subwoofer to the proper position. \r

      At last, I must say, the sound quality of Razer Leviathan is
      terrific as it produces loud sound despite its short size. The voice's
      clarity is promising, and the drivers or other features adjust
      automatically to deliver quality performance. \r
