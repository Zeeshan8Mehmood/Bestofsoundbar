  Advancement in technology is undoubtedly outstanding, but it also comes with a
  few drawbacks. Let's take the example of television. Televisions have become
  more fashionable and tech-savvy, but since they have become flatter, the
  incorporation of audio systems does not happen nowadays.

   Due to the lack of an audio system, people have to go for alternatives such as Bluetooth speakers, home theatre, or soundbars. Amidst many options, it cannot be apparent for people to choose a proper audio system for their home. 

  This article will share a brief comparison between the soundbar and Bluetooth speakers so that you can know which audio system is better for your house. In the end, we will also provide a list of the few best Bluetooth speakers and soundbar. 


  ## Comparison Guide Between Soundbar and Bluetooth Speakers


  Both the audio systems are used for extending the audio of a television or any other device in several ways, but they both are pretty different from each other. Let's see how.


  ## Soundbar VS Bluetooth Speakers Overview


  ### Soundbar


  Soundbars are long speakers that you can place below your television or above it whichever way is suitable. You can get audio quality the way you would get if a proper audio system were installed on your television. 


  Because of the placement of the soundbars, you get a more realistic audio experience with this device. Generally, you can operate soundbars independently, or you can use a subwoofer if you require more.


  ### Bluetooth Speakers


  All of us are aware of the concept of Bluetooth. In Bluetooth speakers, the audio does not come straight from the direction of the television, so there are fewer chances of getting a realistic experience, but that doesn't mean they are bad in any sense. You get a 3D sound experience with them. 


  Bluetooth speakers have long battery life, and they are durable. They are compact, and you can place them anywhere in your room and then connect them with your television or any other design so that you can have a louder audio experience. The portability of Bluetooth speakers allows you to carry them even outdoors. 


  Both the devices have the same motive: to provide louder and better audio, but there are various factors in which they differ from each other. Let's look at some of those factors. 


  ### Factors of Comparison


  1. ### Price


  First, let's talk about the price of the two devices; Bluetooth speakers are considered expensive compared to soundbars. We have often seen a lot of soundbars being more costly than a single speaker. 


  But even if one speaker is cheaper than one soundbar, you will have to buy more than one speaker for a better experience, which will cost you more if you buy Bluetooth speakers. So in the comparison of price, the soundbar has the upper hand. 


  2. #### Audio Quality


  Another most important factor is the audio quality which is the sole purpose of these audio systems. In terms of audio quality, speakers generally have better sound quality as compared to a soundbar.

   The only reason for this is that since you can install Bluetooth speakers in different directions, you get an actual cinematic experience even though it is not realistic. 

  Undoubtedly with a soundbar, you get to hear the audio from the direction of the device itself, but the quality of bass and pitch of the sound lacks in it. With Bluetooth speakers, you get to be part of the real action; therefore, in comparing audio quality, Bluetooth speakers take the lead. 


  3. #### Practical Application


  The last factor of comparison between Bluetooth speakers and soundbar is the practical application of the two devices. Both the devices can be installed quickly and do not require any additional power cable for charging or plugging. 


  In practicality, there comes a factor of space in which the soundbar has a disadvantage because of its size. Since soundbars are much longer as compared to speakers, they tend to take up more space. 


  However, speakers can be put anywhere you want, and they don't require to be placed near the television. In terms of portability, Bluetooth speakers are ahead in the game because they can be carried anywhere you want. 


  4. #### Interconnection Feature


  Bluetooth speakers have an additional feature of interconnection that you cannot find in a soundbar. You can conveniently connect multiple Bluetooth speakers, and then you can play sound in sync; however, you cannot connect various soundbars. 


  5. #### Connectivity Options


  Bluetooth speakers do not require any USB for charging on connection. However, various brands required sound was that supports wired connections.

   Sadly, not many people are aware of the wireless soundbars, due to which they prefer Bluetooth speakers. Bluetooth speakers are undoubtedly better if you don't want to have many cables in your house, and you can efficiently operate them. 

  This was the comparison between soundbars and Bluetooth speakers. We hope these factors will give you a clear understanding of the pros and cons of the two audio systems.


  If you want to have a cheap audio system for your home, you should buy a soundbar; however, if the price is not a deciding factor in sound quality, then Bluetooth speakers are the right choice.  


  Below we have provided the list of good Bluetooth speakers and soundbars that you can look at.
