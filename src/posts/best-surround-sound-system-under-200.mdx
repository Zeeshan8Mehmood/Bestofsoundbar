      Any ordinary sound system can deliver an audio quality better than your
      TV's built-in speakers. Still, you should get a hold of the Kplisch
      surround sound system if you are serious or an entertainment lover. You
      can expect a premium audio quality with exciting features and easy control
      with this incredible device. It might be a little hard on the pocket than
      all the other system we were discussing, but it is worth every penny. 


      The simple ordinary look can automatically increase the value of your other digital devices while pairing. It is a compact 5.1 set-up that's a significant update than the previous ones. Unlike competitors, it does not have any funky appearance or LED displays, but what's it worth, it knows its job perfectly well. 


      Furthermore, we find four satellites featuring 3.5 inches iconic drivers and a single tweeter if we see in-depth speakers. The whole set is merely around 4.5 inches wide, and the depth would be around 5.5 inches. So, setting it only on the TV table would throw a beautiful vibe to your room. Lastly, this ironic product comes with 8-inches wireless subwoofer, which is super easy to connect. 


      I did not experience extra effort to connect this beautiful piece because all the wired and wireless connections are reliable. You can connect this surround sound over the latest Bluetooth version and pair it with your phones, tabs, and TVs. However, if your TV does not support wireless connectivity, you can pair both devices via Aux cable. 


      So, get yourself ready to fill your room with loud voices and treat yourself with starting a new season on Netflix because the dialogues will be clear than ever, and controlling the modes will be more accessible.
    pros:
      - Easy pairing.
      - Pretty design.
      - "Compact. "
      - "Easy set-up. "
      - "Wireless subwoofer. "
