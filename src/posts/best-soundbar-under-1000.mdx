      The remote control makes things more accessible with all the dedicated buttons at your fingertips.

      All these fancy brands and their glossy products confuse you? No worries!
      Invest in the Bose soundbar 700 and fill your life with a rich soundstage
      with excellent audio configuration support. 


      Besides, it comes with a minimalist glass design that can be distracting while streaming the TV, but you can utilize the mounting brackets and fix it on the wall. 


      Bose did not offer much for the sake of physical connections. Still, we have an HDMI output, USB, optical digital, an Ethernet cable port for wired internet service, and a 3.5mm audio jack to connect a subwoofer. You can also connect the ADAPTiQ headset via this input. However, it's a shame that Bose did not include HDMI inputs even at this price. 


      Though the Bose 700 comes with a metal remote control that seems to have some dedicated buttons, you can also use the Bose Music App with a friendly interface, which allows you to make some basic adjustments to the Soundbar and provide access to the numerous exciting features and built-in programs. You can also opt for built-in Voice control with Google Assistant and Alexa to manage your Soundbar along with other Smart devices. 


      Moreover, the Soundbar can decode a 5.1 channel system with Dolby Digital and DTS support. This single unit device can struggle in movies but can be an ideal choice for Music and TV. Four mid-range drivers and central tweeters at either side produce fantastic sound.
    pros:
      - Audio Calibration with ADAPTiQ
      - "Voice control "
      - "Dedicated app "
      - Single unit

      movies, and gaming. Its voice enhancement with dialogue clarity function
      keeps us hooked on it regardless of Dolby Atmos' support.

      The four sound modes of the Soundbar perform their job better. The standard mode delivers the original audio of the content, surround mode adds crispiness to the content, best for movies and Shows. Finally, the game mode gives you a premium experience, throwing vibes like you are in the game.
