      JBL 5.1 channel soundbar is a valuable update to the JBL bar with
      Multibeam tech, which is ten times better than its previous models. It
      intends to keep all the speakers in the main soundbar and deliver the
      users' high-end listening experience. However, the main soundbar also
      includes five drivers and about two tweeters on either side, using the
      space efficiently. 


      It is the best soundbar for Sony TV because it showcases a simple design with the power switch and volume controls at the top. In contrast, connectivity ports are at the back to save yourself from a mess. It offers HDMI input, HDMI ARC, optical digital port, a USB, an Ethernet port for connectivity. Moreover, the soundbar for Sony TV also provides wireless connectivity with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connection. This way, you can connect your Sony Bravia TV within seconds and enjoy the incredible listening experience. 


      Surprisingly bar 5.1 performs pretty well with virtual surround sound and delivers rich, powerful sound with good dialogue clarity. The soundbar ensures you understand every bit of content you are streaming. Though it performs well with Movies and TV Shows, I find a little distortion at fast music, maybe because of treble level. No worries, it measures 90 dB at a max volume that should have dramatic vibes in the living room. 


      Finally, apart from terrific audio quality, it has an easy-to-understand yet straightforward setup. It won't take much time to connect with your Sony Bravia 4K TV, but you can take help from the remote control to making some changes and manage your soundbar accordingly.
