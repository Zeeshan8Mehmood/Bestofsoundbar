      With a simple and minimalist design, this small and black color soundbar
      is breathtaking. It may be a little costly, but the sound quality it
      produces is worth everything. It does not contain any buttons on it, so
      you need to set it up with the remote control. The bonus thing is, you can
      use this universal remote control on other relative devices. The remote
      control has different options that you can use to adjust settings.

However, there is no HDMI input, so make sure your device has an optical cable connection to make it connected with your soundbar. The Bluetooth option is also not reliable, so you have to adjust with these available inputs.

Though the sound is clear even without enabling dialogue clarity mode, you can still use it to experience something comprehensive. The voice of the BOSE Solo 5 is loud enough, so if your TV's integrated speakers are not good enough, then you can consider buying it.

      It delivers impressive sound in a small compact size soundbar. Its 2.1
      channel and subwoofer combination is a hit in the market. The overall
      appearance of the soundbar is minimal yet decent. I can stand for its
      build quality because the brand is famous for its durable material. The
      black fabric grille around the soundbar with a matte black top looks
      incredible. 


      It also showcases an LED display that indicates the activity you are performing on the soundbar, like connecting HDMI inputs, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi connection. Right beside the display, you get to see buttons for volume adjustments, etc. Moreover, I call it an entry-level soundbar because of all the essential features it offers. The overall sound quality is impressive because of the strong firing speakers at the front. It also includes a wireless subwoofer for the perfect bass performance. 


      The soundbar supports Dolby Digital, Dolby Pro Logic II, and DTS Digital surround to ensure the delivery of loud yet clear sound. It can take your listening experience to the next level. Besides, the dialogue clarity is promising. You can also call this speaker a smart one, as it supports voice control with Alexa. There are several surround modes besides the DTS Virtual:X. The modes include Music, TV, movies, etc. This soundbar is an overall device for all your entertainment needs.

      Finally, we have our last product in the best soundbar for dialogue
      clarity review list. It is another excellent product from Bose because the
      small-sized soundbars struggle to deliver clear sound, but the Bose knows
      how to deal with this issue. It is the cutest and well-designed soundbar
      you would ever see. You can place it on the table, or it can be
      wall-mounted without compromising its looks. Also, the buttons are on the
      side, so you can operate the soundbar even while mounting it on the wall. 


      Similarly, it comes with easy to use remote control, which is also sensible in the design. Even though the buttons are here on the bar, you still may need a remote to add a subwoofer or make different adjustments. It features a 3.0 channel sound and a widening PhaseGuide tech to enhance the overall sound quality, providing you a luxurious experience while streaming your favorite thriller series. Besides, there is no separate subwoofer, but the QuietPort feature will help you get the best possible bass experience.


      If you are a fan of Spotify, pandora then I have good news for you. This best soundbar has a built-in SoundTouch Wi-Fi music system that lets you connect to these platforms and listen to the original sound. It factually makes the sound more interesting, clear, and worth hearing. Also, you can connect your devices with a smooth wireless Bluetooth connection.  Unfortunately, we see no headphone jack, but I think the HDMI port is enough to cover the pitfall. The sound quality is clear, loud, and fresh with Dolby Digital and DTS features.
