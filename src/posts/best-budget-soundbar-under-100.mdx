      We have the best soundbar under 100 Sony HT-S100F for dialogue. This
      built-in 2.0 setup best budget soundbar is excellent for listening to
      audio-focused content like podcasts, audiobooks, and TV shows. It can also
      get loud enough to use a lot of pressure in noisy rooms or crowded
      parties, which is pretty good in this budget.


      Although it lacks many basses and a little detail in the treble range, its balanced mid-range is perfect for reproducing dialogue-filled content such as TV shows. There is also a voice mode dialogue enhancement feature and an auto-volume mode. That can balance the volume level between different programs and ads. If you want to listen to podcasts and audiobooks, you can also transfer audio from your phone or tablet to a wireless bar via Bluetooth.


      Unfortunately, it lacks a deep, small, thumping bass, so it would not be ideal for listening to a bass-heavy music genre or action-packed movie scenes. It does not have high channels, so it does not support Dolby Atos content. However, it does come with an all-time sound feature called S-Force Front Surround, which can help create a better listening experience.

    pros:
      - Best soundbar for dialogue clarity.

      provides a real audio upgrade to your TV built-in speaker. Virtual X
      technology also works well, helping to create a more immersive environment
