      and soft voice quality. I would not say it is merely a soundbar because it
      features many qualities like eight built-in drivers, amplification, and a
      4K HDMI pass-through. Also, it contains four surround speakers and two
      wireless subwoofers. Though subwoofers are relatively large, I think all

      The soundbar's first impression is exciting as it showcases six 2.5
      inches, full-range drivers at the front with their amplification. Two
      drivers serve the center channel purpose; one is the right/left channel,
      and the other two work. Also, it contains two subwoofers on each side of
      the soundbar. In short, it will be a valuable investment that will give
      you a luxurious sound system comparing with your Apple 4K TV. \r
