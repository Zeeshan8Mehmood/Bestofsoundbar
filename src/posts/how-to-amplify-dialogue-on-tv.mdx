  Sound problems are something that a lot of people complain about when watching
  movies on TV. During action scenes, mainly shooting and blasting where more
  music is pumped in, and even producing extra bases, background music is turned
  up.


  Our hearing is impaired because we can't listen clearly to what the actors are speaking, because the background music is too loud. 


  It feels so frustrating that we are no longer given a choice. Despite this, the desire to watch movies at home on TV drastically dampens.

  ## Ways to Amplify Dialogue on TV

Therefore, when you want to watch a movie, apply the movie mode sound effect. This will give you a thrilling movie-watching experience.

  ### Enable Dynamic Range Compression


  TV models have taken into consideration an essential need for sound quality since movie casters are focusing on cinematic sound quality for today's movies instead of the standard speakers. We can therefore enjoy a thrilling movie-watching experience. 


  Generally speaking, in order to achieve voice balancing on TV(s), there was a trend to include a function something like **Dynamically Changing Frequencies**, since due to improvements in sound quality it was not feasible to make TV speakers compete with a theater's speakers.


  Therefore, these days TVs are increasingly equipped with this function called dynamic range compression. If enabled, it compresses the frequencies of sound. The feature for sure, not something to enhance sound quality rather works as a virtual remote volume controller. The dynamic range of a soundtrack is reduced through the compression of files, not by shrinking digital file sizes.


  Several brands of television are coming with this function built into it. Well, the name might be different for each brand, and you might don’t want to tweak all settings options to check out this feature. And you don’t need to.


  Here are the most common names, check an option with a similar name. Enable it on.


  Dynamic range compression lowers loud sounds (music and sound effects) and raises softer sounds (vocals and dialogue) so that all sounds are at a similar level. Depending on the brand and model of TV or another device, dynamic range compression goes by several names such as:


  * DRC (Dynamic Range Control)

  * Speech or Dialog Enhancement

  * Volume Leveling

  * Clear Voice (LG)

  * Dolby Volume (Dolby Labs)

  * Accuvoice (Zvox Audio)

  * Audyssey Dynamic Volume (Audyssey)

  * Reduce Loud Sounds (Apple)

  * Studio Sound and TruVolume (DTS)F


  ### Amplify Dialogue on Apple TV


  The latest Apple 4k TV released in 2017 has this function built into it. If you have this model or the newest one, you can enable the dynamic sound mode by going into your Apple TV’s settings by pressing the menu button on the remote. Click enter onto the Gear icon to get into the settings page. Now, audio and video option> and enable the option naming **Reduce loud sound**.


  ### Use Wireless Headphones


  Although somewhat out of the topic, we decided it should be included as well. If you have never tried watching movies wearing headphones, prepare to be pleasantly surprised by the quality of sound you will hear. Only you if you don’t mind wearing headphones in the first place.


  The use of headphones would be ideal for people who watch television late at night, during which other family members are sleeping at home. Although keeping TV volume low is always the best option, there are a few important things to deal with when it comes to TV sound. If you cannot figure out what’s wrong, headphones might do the trick, solving all your problems.


  Despite only telling possible ways we’re not able to find out the exact reason. Because you might be someone who’s going through all the ways just to make sound clear and less background music. 


  Plug headphones into the headphone jack on the back of most TVs. But you will need wired headphones, of course, the short cord will be a problem unless you purchase an extension wire to attach with your wired cable.


  Wireless headphones may be more convenient to use. 


  The latest TVs sometimes have wireless Bluetooth built-in. Maybe you could pair Bluetooth headphones. In General, TV supports wireless headphones, try and check yours!
