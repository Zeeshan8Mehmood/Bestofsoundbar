      Philips B5/37 is another beautiful soundbar with lots of attractive
      features. It has a minimalist soft design that combines with compact size
      to boost the modern décor. It won't consume much space, so you can place
      it under your TV or mount it on the wall because you do not have to worry
      about connecting it with Philips TV. 


      The connections come with a Bluetooth option that allows wireless music streaming and two HDMI ports to connect to other devices. Though it works well as the Philips Fidelio soundbar with any compatible device effortlessly, it can connect through a one-touch function via NFC technology and HDMI ARC that would access all the sound from your TV. 


      Furthermore, the Dolby Digital 5.1 and Pro Logic II play a vital role in delivering high-quality audio with accurate dialogues. DTS Digital Surround makes sure you have home theatre vibes with rich sound as it can decode high-resolution audio, and the premium tweeters ensure a crystal clear distortion-free listening experience.

      Get an excellent virtual surround sound with Philips 2.0 channel soundbar.
      It is one of the valuable products from the Philips soundbar 1000 series
      with the potential to connect with any relative device and perform beyond
      expectations.


      It is the best soundbar for Philips TV because it brings ease of connectivity via Bluetooth and HDMI ARC. It also has two built-in full-range drivers responsible for delivering rich and powerful sound from all directions. It comes with a down-firing subwoofer to deliver imaginary bass performance, which adjusts the rumble automatically while playing different content. 


      Moreover, the Philips soundbar seems stylish with the matte finishing and slim portable design. For me, it is the best soundbar for Philips Ambilight TV, as its 3ft long height suits with big screen size TV, though it would not block a view or distract you while watching TV. You will see a metal grill at the front covers the speakers or drivers and the LED indicator that helps you monitor the functions you perform. It is better to place the wireless subwoofer on the floor rather than on the shelf within the Bluetooth range. 


      <FeaturesBox title="Main Features Of Philips 2.0 Soundbar" features={["Dual full-range speakers.","Wireless down-firing subwoofer.","Clear dialogue delivery.","Three audio presets.","Rich sound delivery."]} />
    pros:
      - Remote control.

      - HDMI ARC.
