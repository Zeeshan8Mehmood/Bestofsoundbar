      Usually, high-end TVs fail to deliver high-quality audio, which raises the
      need for external speakers. Denon knew this fact pretty well and designed
      the pro-level soundbars, which can never match the TV’s built-in speakers’
      low-end quality and features. 


      Similarly, Denon DHT-S216  is a decent-looking soundbar that measures around 35-inches wide and 2.35-inches in height. The front has speakers with no display, and all the connectivity ports are at the back. The inputs include HDMI ARC, Toslink optical, Aux cable, and one extra HDMI port. 


      If we talk about the soundbar’s inside, you will get 3-inch downward subwoofers, two mid-range drivers, and two tweeters of 1-inch each. It can get extra loud, but you can control the volume according to your mood. However, if you are a loud sound freak, there is a 3D audio surround sound with DTS Virtual:X  for the clear and loud audio that will deliver an overhead listening experience.


      Finally, the setup of this best soundbar for bedroom won’t take your time, and with the help of remote control, you will put it on in no time.  You only need to set your TV to HDMI ARC, connect the soundbar, and enjoy. 


      <FeaturesBox title="Main Features Of Denon DHT-S216" features={["3D Audio system.","DTS Virtual:X.","Two built-in down-firing subwoofers.","Dual mid-range drivers.","Built-in Tweeters.","The audio clarity is impressive."]} />
