  Televisions have undergone a significant change in technology in recent times,
  and the drastic shift can be seen in display technology and inbuilt speakers. 


  Most of the televisions nowadays do not come with inbuilt speakers because they are pretty slim. Therefore, they don't have the area to have speakers because the entire sound experience can become highly average.

   In short, when you watch an action-packed movie or listen to your favorite artist on the television, you won't be able to have the similar kind of sound quality that you might get with the older television models.

  #### Where Does Home Theatre System Lack? 


  Even though a home theatre system offers precisely the kind of surround sound and sound experience that users want to have with an external audio system, the home theatre speakers are a bit messy when it comes to setup.

   Indeed the customization of the setup is possible, but home theatre systems are most likely to involve a clutter of wires that will not give a minimal setup as the way you get with soundbars. Other than this minor drawback home theatre system can be the best choice for your external audio system.

  * The components of a home theatre system are a bit complex to set.

  If we get to choose between the soundbar and home theatre system, we will go for the home theatre system because it has better surround sound quality. With different setup channels, you get the leverage to decide which surround system you want to choose.

   Yes, it has a complex setup procedure, but once it is done, you will be able to experience a movie theatre in the comfort of your home. 

  Soundbars are also a great choice of audio system if you want to have a minimal setup at an affordable price, but you will have to compromise on 3D sound quality and surround sound features. 


  Undoubtedly, the sound quality you get from the  Soundbar is better than what you get from your TV speakers, but it is not better than a home theatre system. 


  Both the audio systems have their advantages and disadvantages, but in comparison, home theatre speakers have the upper hand with better sound quality and features. 


  #### Additional Important Information


  Choosing an ideal external audio system is not an easy task. You have to keep in mind various factors and aspects whether you are looking for a perfect home theatre speaker, soundbar, or Bluetooth speaker.

   Some of those critical aspects are sensitivity, power handling, and frequency response, and all of these aspects combine to form a powerful audio system for your home.

   It is essential that you carefully analyze these factors before choosing between the soundbar and home theatre speaker.

   The average frequency range of an audio system should be from 20 to 20000 Hz because the frequency lower than this will not give you a good listening experience. 

  If you have an audio system that does not have a high-frequency range, you can pair them with a subwoofer to optimize the sound quality and your overall sound experience.
